## Hi folks.

Here, you can find all the chapterwise *keyfindings* of **Eloquent JavaScript Book**.


# **EJS Chapter-1: Introduction:**

Let's understand the technical terms:

**Program:**   A set of instructions that tells the computer what to do next. 

**Programming:**    A act of constructing a program.

**Programming Language:**    It is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers.


# **Intro to JavaScript:**


JavaScript was introduced in **1995** by **Brendan Eich** as a way to add programs to web pages in the *Netscape Navigator browser*.

## **Why the name JavaScript?**

Initially, JavaScript's first name is **Mocha**. Later, it is changed to **LiveScript** and then to **JavaScript**.

So,  the talk behind choosing the name **JavaScript** is :

At that time, Java is famous programming language. So, for marketing purpose LiveScript is changed into JavaScript.

## **Is there any connection between Java and JavaScript?**

Absolutely, NO. There is nothing in common.

## **What is ECMAScript standard?**

- It is a standard document which was written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work.

- Ecma International organization did this standardization.

**Ecma International:**  It is an industry association founded in 1996, dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems.

- The terms **ECMAScript** and **JavaScript** can be used interchangeably â€” they are two names for the same language.


      1997     ->   ES1 
      2009     ->   ES5 (Have a lots of new features)
      2015     ->   ES6 (ES2015- Biggest update for JS)
                    ES6 is also known as Modern JavaScript


 
## **Features of JavaScript:**


- Case-sensitive

- Dynamically Tped

- Cross-platform

- Interpreted

- Object Oriented Scripting Language

- Backward Compatible


Its just an intro part of JS to revise concepts. That's it for today. 

Bye for now.
